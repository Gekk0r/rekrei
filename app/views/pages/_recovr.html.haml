        RecoVR: Mosul
        %br
        a collective reconstruction
      %p
        In 2015, we had the pleasure of collaborating with the Economist Media Lab to create the first virtual reconstruction of the Mosul Cultural Museum, the destruction of which was the catalyst for Rekrei. The creation of the virtual museum represents an important step for the project in that we have seen the collective reconstructions now brought forward for retelling through virtual reality.
