        %p
          Rekrei, formally known as Project Mosul, is an initiative started by Matthew Vincent and Chance Coughenour. By integrating our knowledge in archaeology, web development, and photogrammetry, our objective is to promote the digital preservation of lost cultural heritage using crowdsourced data in a cooperative, open-source project.
