        %h3 Project Mosul
        %p
          Project Mosul is an initative started by Matthew Vincent (ITN-DCH Researcher), Chance Coughenour (ITN-DCH Researcher), and Marinos Ioannides (ITN-DCH Coordinator) of the Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage, a Marie Curie Actions FP7-PEOPLE funded project. The project is a response to the destruction of cultural heritage by the Islamic States, and proposes to use crowd-sourced imagery to digitally reconstruct the heritage that has been destroyed.

          = link_to '4d-CH-World', "http://www.4d-ch-world.eu/", target: "_blank"
          a FP7-PEOPLE IAPP project, and
          = link_to 'Europeana Space', "http://www.europeana-space.eu/", target: "_blank"
          also a European Union project. We are also working with private industry, particularly 
          = link_to 'Sketchfab', "https://sketchfab.com", target: "_blank"
          a start-up focusing on 3D content on the web, a sort of YouTube for 3D Objects. Together, we are working on a framework for the digital restoration and curation of lost heritage, with the ultimate goal to provide virtual reality access to these museums online.
